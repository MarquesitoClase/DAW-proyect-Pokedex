if you go to localhost:9000/pokedex, you will see that the points that mark the definition of diferent's game's 
pokedex list are into the td of the pokemon name visually. Tthere need be putted in on one line to under, 
looking better. To make that last, it will be nice change the CSS to make it be centered to be in column and not like it's now.
